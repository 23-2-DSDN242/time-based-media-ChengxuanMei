project title time based meida clock Sunset clock

project description
This project is to create an alarm, inspired by the concept of a sunset. It creates the a city skyline backdrop depicting sunrise and sunset, the sun dynamically changes size and background color as time progresses.The clock dynamically changes over time, 7am to 6pm is daytime and 6pm to 6am is nighttime, with the sun expanding and contracting as seconds pass, visually representing the passage of time. 
During the process of creating this project, my greatest challenge emerged in deciding upon a theme. I often found myself grappling with uncertainty, unsure of where to begin. It wasn't until one evening on March 16th when a friend invited me to Victoria Mountain to overlook the entirety of Wellington. The city's neon lights adorned the enchanting night, while the distant starry sky shimmered brightly, which inspired me to create this work.
Another challenge I faced was my time management. Throughout the entire project, I found myself constantly trying to catch up with the course schedule. Our assignment is due on the 21st, and it wasn't until the 16th that I had the inspiration. Then, I had to sketch out my ideas and proceed with creating my work, which give me very little time to create the work. Therefore, it crucial for my next project to better manage my time, allowing myself enough time to create the work I envision.

what was your motivation?
Creating work that I love is my motivation. When I'm writing code, I always feel excited. Once I have my ideas, I envision what my work will look like when finished. The process to constantly adjust the colors, refine the details bit by bit, and strive to make the work the best it can be, is the part I enjoy most.

why did you build this project what problem does it solve 
I have the problems when i create the background. Initially, I want to upload background that I had drawn, but after numerous attempts, I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. Eventually, I realized that using simple shapes to create the background by coding might give the project more style. So, I began constructing the background use coding to build simple shapes.
